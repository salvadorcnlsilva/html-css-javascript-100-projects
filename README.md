# 100 html-css-javascript projects
by _Salvador Silva_

## Why?

The aim of this repository is for me to store my small websites regarding some new knowledge in html, css and javascript.  
I'm doing this because I want to learn how to design better websites. I never really understood CSS (my Achilles Heel in web developing) and never tried javascript.  
My personal goal is to commit at leat one new website a day.

## Credits

I'm following a tutorial playlist by [HuXn WebDev](https://www.youtube.com/@huxnwebdev). I'm making each of his projects, so they will be pretty similar to his (if not equal some of them, just changing colors etc).
This is the course: [HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript 100+ Projects For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSDeUiTMfxW7lm7P7GZ8qtNFffHAR5d_w).
